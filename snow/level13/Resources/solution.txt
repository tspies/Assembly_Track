 We can solve this problem using the <gdb> debugging tool.

Start debugging: gdb ./level13

Now once we are in debugging mode we can set a break point at main:
break main

Now lets load the main function from our breakpoint onwards:
x/20i main

Now that we can see the whole main function, we know that the function uses the system function getuid(),
and then we see the cmp instruction in line <main + 14>

Now lets set a break point on that line:
break *main + 14

Now lets continue to run the function.
It should break on the cmp command.

Lets check the value of $eax:
p $eax

We should get: $1 = 2013

We know from the exe output that uid needs to be 4242
set $eax = 4242

Check the value of $eax again:
p $eax

Now our uid is set to 4242
Lets continue running the function:
cont

Your flag should be displayed.
