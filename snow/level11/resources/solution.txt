This level we can see a good example of why user input validation is important.
If you open the .lua file you will see a function called hash which uses echo, a shell command.

The hash function does not validate the input so we can inject commmands into it.
Shell commands are seperated by ';'

First we start up the socket with telnet:
telnet 127.0.0.1 5151

Now that it asks for the password we inject out command.

1;/bin/getflag > /tmp/flag11; echo 1

We inserted the output from getflag into /tmp/flag11
The flag is found inside there.

FLAG: fa6v5ateaw21peobuub8ipe6s
