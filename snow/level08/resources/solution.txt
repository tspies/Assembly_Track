 make a symlin between 'token' and a file in /tmp/

ln -s /home/user/level08/token /tmp/level08

Once that is done, run the executable with that file as a parameter.

./level08 /tmp/level8

TOKEN: qui5eloekouj29ke0vouxean

Use the token to log into flag08 and run the getflag command

FLAG: 25749xKZ8L7DkSCwJkT9dyv6f
