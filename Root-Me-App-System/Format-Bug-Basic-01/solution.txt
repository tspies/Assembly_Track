* Notice the executable is x86 architecture so memry output will be in little endian.

* Run python command as parameter:
$(python -c 'print "%04x."*5')

* Take the output and copt paste it into a little endian to Big endian converter.
* Now take the Big Endian output and run it through a hex to ascii converter.

* There should only be certain characters that are normal ascii, others will be gibberish.
