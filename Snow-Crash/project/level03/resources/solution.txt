Run the executable with ltrace:

ltrace ./level03

Closer look shows that it looks for the the `echo` exexcutable using the `env` variable.

The `env` searches the enviroment vairable $(PATH) for the executable found in (/user/bin/ )

So now we know that the program looks for an executable in /user/bin/ name `echo` using the default $PATH variable.

We now recreate the program level03 using the ltrace as reference. create this new program in the /tmp folder with vim.
We call this program echo.c, everything about this program is the same as level03 but we change the path to look for the 
executable `getflag` instead of `echo`

After this is done in /tmp, we compile the program and name the executable `echo`



So now we have a duplicate executable named `echo` in the tmp folder.

Now we modify the $PATh variable:
"export PATH=/tmp/:${PATH}"
This now adds /tmp as a path that the level03 will look in for an executable called `echo`. becuase we have created our own executable called `echo`, it will run and call the executable get flag, which will show us the flag.

now we go back to the level03 executable and run it, it will call our executable in /tmp and will call the getflag executable.
