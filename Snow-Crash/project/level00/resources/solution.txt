In this level we search for files that are owned by user flag00(since flag00 has the rights to run getflag)

* We run find / -user "flag00" |& grep -v "Permission"
* We find a file called john in /usr/sbin
* We then run the contents of the file on the decrypter site http://dcode.fr/rot-cipher which reveals the password NOTTOOHARDHERE!
