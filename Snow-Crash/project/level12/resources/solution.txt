In the level the is perl file which has two functions `t` and `n`

In this case we cannot inject a path to our exploit file, because in the function
`t` it takes the $xx variable and makes all the characters uppercase.

This means that if we pass '/tmp/exlpoit' it will become '/TMP?EXPLOIT'
And our file would not be found.


First we create our EXPLOIT.c file and compile it, the executable has to have and upper-case name to satisfy the Uppercase needed but the perl file.

Our injection command will be "`/*/EXPLOIT`"
We use the '*' to instruct the shell to search for any files named EXPLOIT.

Before we inject this command we need to url encode it with 'urlencode'
%60%2F%2A%2FEXPLOIT%60

Now we inject our command:

curl 'localhost:4242/level12.pl?x=%60%2F%2A%2FEXPLOIT%60'

Now that we have a shell running we can call getflag.
