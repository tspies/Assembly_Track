level04
In the folder /home/user/level04 we are given a perl script level04.perl

The script uses CGI which will serve up a webpage of content-type text/html.
The script also accepts a parameter 'x' wich it runs through a subroutine that echoes it out and pipes it to the stdout using 2>&1

The exploit here is that this prints out the parameter input directly without hashing or verifying input;
Theoretically if we pass `getflag` as the x parameter it should be run as a command

We curl the webpage served by CGI on the supplied port 4747 with the command:
	curl 'localhost:4747/level04.pl?x=`getflag`' and voila we get the flag.
