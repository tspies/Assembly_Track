 If you cat the level06.php you will see that the file has two functions 'x' and 'y'
Function y is just a dummy function so forget that.
Fucntion 'x' is the one we will look at.

Function has two parameters ($y, $z)
The 'file_get_contents' function will retrieve the contents of a file, we will use thsi fuction to read the code in our exploit file we will create later.

Now lets take a look at the first 'preg_replace', notice that its first argument looks for the string [x(.*)].
We will exploit this preg_replace using the '/e' in the first argument of preg_replace.

The '/e' will execute the second argument of the preg_replace as a php expression.
Now we can create our exploit file called 'injection' in /tmp/

Now in our file we write: echo '[x {${system(sh)}}]'
This will inject the 'system' executable and run a shell (sh).

Now run the ./level06 /tmp/injection

Now once our shell is running we can execute the 'getflag' command and retrieve our flag.
