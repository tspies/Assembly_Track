su level02
password is flag from flag01

* In root of level02 there is a file level02.pcap

* We run it through cloudshark.org

 *line 42: contains password:

  every character sent afterwards reveals

  ft_wandr...NDRel.L0L.....

        66 74 5f 77 61 6e 64 72
        7f 7f 7f 4e 44 52 65 6c 
        7f 4c 30 4c 0d 00 0d 0a 01

   but characters 7f = 127 which is DEL

   therefore answer is

   ft_waNDReL0L
