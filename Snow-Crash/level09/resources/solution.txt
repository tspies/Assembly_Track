We are given an ELF executible and a token file.
The token file contains random characters
we run the executable on the token file and realise that it increments the ascii characters by i
e.g ./level08 aaaa >> abcd

we then run an ltrace on the executible which reveals the following message "Do not reverse this". Coincidence? I think not;

We run a small c program that subtracts the characters by i
e.g ./level08 zzzz >> zyxw

this reveals our token
